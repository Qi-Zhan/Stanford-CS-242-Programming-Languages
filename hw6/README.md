# Homework 6: Continuations

I downloaded Racket from the [downloads] page. In retrospect the [minimal] version would have sufficed, though I did find DrRacket useful for interactive Racketeering. I installed the [Racket extension] for VS Code to get syntax highlighting. Magic Racket looks way fancier, but it also looks harder to set up.

PLT Scheme was [renamed] Racket in 2010. I remember using DrScheme in COMP 210 at Rice way back in 2002.
